# Skills Documentation

This site is the reading surface for the skill library. For repository setup and development workflow, see:
https://github.com/psiace/skills#readme

## Quick Start

1. Pick a skill from the index below.
2. Read the skill's `SKILL.md` first (purpose, triggers, workflow).
3. Dive into references for deeper topics and examples.

## Skill Index

| Skill | Focus | Entry |
| --- | --- | --- |
| friendly-python | Friendly, Pythonic, maintainable code | [SKILL.md](friendly-python/SKILL.md) |
| piglet | Python craftsmanship patterns and pitfalls | [SKILL.md](piglet/SKILL.md) |
| fast-rust | Fast, reliable, maintainable Rust code | [SKILL.md](fast-rust/SKILL.md) |

## Navigation Notes

- The left sidebar mirrors the skill structure and topic references.
- References are intentionally small and focused to keep context tight.

## Conventions

- Prefer correctness and clarity over micro-optimizations.
- Keep guidance actionable and scoped to real engineering decisions.
